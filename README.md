# React + Vite

## This is a straightforward project aimed at gaining a deeper understanding of Redux-Toolkit. I've been following a [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7jaHPqef10) from the [JAB](https://www.youtube.com/@soyjab) YouTube channel to help me comprehend how Redux works :)

- I added some additional features to play with the knowledge that I've gained from this tutorial.

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
